Significant innovation has opened the market to increased competition while expanding features and capabilities, and dramatically driven down cost for consumers. As competition has increased so too has the complexity of navigating licensing and patent concerns in the space. The rapid influx of Linux-based consumer electronics is a prime example of why technology business leaders need a deep understanding of how leading Open Source stakeholders address challenges and seize opportunities. Shane Coughlan, Global Director of Licensing for Open Invention Network, will outline ways that companies can insulate themselves from risk while continuing to drive market demand and encouraging competition.",

I would like to introduce the background, the proposal of Fedora.next, and then talked about what are being done, what are still to be done, and what can everyone do to make the architecture design come true.
